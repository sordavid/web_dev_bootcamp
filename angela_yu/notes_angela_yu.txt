### differences between classes and IDs video 40
# you can't use ID everywhere 
# you can use class everywhere
# you would use to identify elements where there is only a single element such as a heading / nav bar
# ID selector selects only one unique element.


### <span>
# it is a generic inline container for phrasing content

### display: inline-block;
# lets you change width and adds block orientation to text

### position properties for css 
## position: relative;
# adds margin to allows position to be moved relative to where it is
## position: static;
# keeps position still
## position: absolute;
# adding margin to its parent element

## text-align:center;
# inside a container will center everything inside that doesn't have a width set
# if something has a width, then you must use margin: 0 auto 0; to change it as well


### font-size: 10rem;
# is least error prone and will lock into whatever element it is assigned to

### float properties CSS
# .tennis-img 
#    width: 15%;
#    float: left; <--- this line
# float will let your img float to different sides of the code

### clear properties CSS

# this will basically make sure the left side is completely clear
